# Source

This folder contains the source code written for this research project.
This is the core of any replication bundle.
Running the code in this folder, in a well-defined order, should replicate research results down to the last decimal figure and down to the pixel of each figure.

This folder should not only contain the code written ad-hoc for this research folder, but should also contain any external dependency that is necessary to ensure a clean replication run.
Examples are your own LaTeX/MATLAB/Python/Stata/R libraries, or templates.


## Dependencies

- LaTeX
  - article, beamer
  - amsmath, amssymb, amsfonts
