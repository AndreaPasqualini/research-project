# Build

This folder is empty on the checked-out version of the repository.
It should be populated only locally by intermediate files created in the build process.
The build process is the sequence of commands and programs that are run in order to produce clean datasets, figures, tables, the draft of the paper and some presentation slides.

The existence of this ReadMe file ensures that the `build` folder exists in the repository.
This is necessary for the programs used, which expect this folder to exist.
